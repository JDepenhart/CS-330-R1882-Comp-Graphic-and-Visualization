How do I approach designing software?
To start off, I chose an image that I believed I would be able to make by the end of the term. My inspiration for this image revolved around practicality as well as challenge. I knew I would need to create at least four objects and one needed to be complex (consisting of multiple primitives). However, based on my knowledge from previous courses, I assumed that drawing each primitive would happen in their own classes and the process for drawing an individual primitive could be reused. Ergo, I could make my objects as complex as I wanted, so long as I could identify the primitives I would need. This assumption proved to be correct, the only challenge was determining the position, scale a rotation for each object, which was handled in development. 

How do I approach developing programs?
My development process relied heavily on compartmentalization. Because I was drawing so many shapes, I needed to have a strong sense of organization to be able to write and maintain code. After the first milestone, I separated my project into regions. Each subsequent milestone I would see what was new and focus only on the applicable regions. For the final projects, I could then focus on what I needed to add and tackle them based on complexity. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
My goal is to be a programmer. Each class in this degree teaches me new concepts that apply to different disciplines in this field. With them I can gain perspective on the different aspects of programming and project development.
